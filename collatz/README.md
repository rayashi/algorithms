# Collatz conjecture

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

n -> n/2 (if n is even)
n -> 3n + 1 (if n is odd)

For example 

13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Which positive integer X < 1000000 give the longest senquence
